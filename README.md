====================
This repo explains how the tidying script works.

##Steps:
The initial "read files" section loads data from source files (see codebook). The comments number the steps in order of assignment, to make grading easier. The actual order of invocation is defined by data necessity and efficiency.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
